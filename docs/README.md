## **Pathogen Genomics Training Workshop**

This training is aimed at providing the utility of metagenomic sequencing in pathogen detection. 
Participants will have hands-on experience with the wet lab experiments as well as bioinformatics analysis of metagenomics data for pathogen detection. Refer to the training schedule below for details. 

**Participant registration:** All particpants are required to complete the registration form at this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x4La0OaNaTgOCK6cj2FXeNSSdEa5-HAy6LmtiWyTXAA/edit).
